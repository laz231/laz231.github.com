<h1>Final Project- Commonwealth Skillshare</h1>
<h2>Reasons why this is an awesome final project:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's for a real group with real people</li>
    <li>It will be used (in real life) pretty frequently</li>
    <li>Its a multi-page site with a lot of content</li>
    <li>The site needs a lot of interactivity that I have not yet incorporated including a dynamic calendar, submissions for proposals, and a blog that needs to be uploaded regularly</li>
    <li>It would be a good site to try and build in Wordpress since I'll need to hand it off to a third party to make content edits</li>
    <li>My friends are bugging me about it</li>
</ul>
