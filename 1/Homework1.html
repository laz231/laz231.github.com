<h1>Small Business - Commonwealth Skillshare</h1>
<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51845452/SkillShare.jpg">Mockup</a>
<p>Commonwealth Skillshare is a group dedicated to the idea that everyone has something to teach. The label "Commonwealth" is meant not only to indicate geographical location, but also to highlight the word's multiple meanings. An investment in self-enrichment can also be an investment in the common good. A skillshare presents an alternative opportunity for education rooted in the belief that learning can be self-motivated and democratic. For Commonwealth Skillshare, teaching takes the form of one-time workshops, led by individuals for other members of the group, on a topic of personal expertise. </p>
